This project is a social networking app that allows users create accounts or sign in using email or through other social network logins. Users will have the ability to create, modify, and delete of events on their account. Users will also be able to see and join events created by other users. Users will be able to see a map of an event location through the google maps api as well as a few other features that will be added along the way. 

This app is built using react with redux for state managment and firebase for the backend. Semantic UI for React is used to style the user interface. React Router is used to control the app as a single-page web application
